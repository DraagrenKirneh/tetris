# Tetris 

A simple tetris clone written in
[zig programming language](https://github.com/andrewrk/zig).

## Status

Once these features are implemented in Zig, this example can work:

 * f32 literals. Currently all floating point literals are f64.
 * `c_int` data type.
 * Ability to include C header files directly from Zig source.
 * Global struct initializers. Currently only struct initializers in functions
   work correctly.
 * Here document or compile time string concatenation for the shaders.
